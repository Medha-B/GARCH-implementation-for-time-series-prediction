# GARCH-implementation-for-time-series-prediction
Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity, or GARCH, is an extension of the ARCH model that incorporates a moving average component together with the autoregressive component.
Specifically, the model includes lag variance terms together with lag residual errors from a mean process.

This code is written for univariate time series analysis and prediction. 
I learnt about this from https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-arch-and-garch-models-for-time-series-forecasting-in-python/
